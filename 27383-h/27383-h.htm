<p class="cap">Freddy the Fish glanced at the
folded newspaper beside him on the
bench. A little one-column headline
caught his eye:</p>

<p class="center">MYSTERIOUS SIGNALS<br />
FROM OUTER SPACE</p>

<p>"Probably from Cygnus," he said.</p>

<p>Freddy mashed a peanut, popped
the meat into his mouth, and tossed
the shell to the curb in front of his
bench. He munched and idly watched
two sparrows arguing over the discarded
delicacy; the victor flitted to
the head of a statue, let go a triumphant
dropping onto the marble nose,
and hopped to a nearby branch.</p>

<p>"Serves him right," Freddy said. He
yawned and rubbed the stubble on
his chin. Not yet long enough for
scissors, he decided. He pulled his
feet up on the bench, twisting in an
effort to get comfortable. The sun was
in his eyes, so he reclaimed the discarded
newspaper and spread it over
his face. His eyes momentarily focused
on MYSTERIOUS SIGNALS
FROM OUTER SPACE, right over
his nose.</p>

<p>"Sure, Cygnus," he muttered, and
closed his eyes and dropped off to
sleep.</p>

<p>When he was awakened, it was by
an excited hand shaking his shoulder
and a panting, "Freddy! Freddy!
Lookit the Extra just came out!"</p>

<p>Freddy slowly sat up, ascertained
the identity of the intruder and the
fact that the sun was setting, and said,
"Good evening, Willy. Please stop
rattling that paper in my face."</p>

<p>"But just read it, Freddy," Willy
shrieked, waving the paper so frantically
that Freddy couldn't make out
the big black headline. "'Positive
contact from another planet,' the guy
was yellin'. They put out an Extra so
I snitched one from the boy. Read it
to me, huh, Freddy? I'm dyin' o' curious."</p>

<p>"So give it here and I'll read it for
you. Quit shakin' it or you'll tear it
all up," Freddy snorted.</p>

<p>"Read it to me, huh, Freddy," Willy
said, handing over the paper. "I don't
know no one else that reads so good."</p>

<p>Freddy studied the headline and
the first paragraph silently, then whistled
lightly and lowered the paper.</p>

<p>"Y'know, Willy," he said, "the last
thing I read before I dropped off a
while ago was about these signals.
But the funny thing is, I'd just assumed
they were from Cygnus."</p>

<p>"What's a Cygnus, Freddy?" Willy
asked, still pop-eyed. "A smoke? A
dame? Or you mean like from Hunger?"</p>

<p>"Cygnus, my boy," Freddy explained
patronizingly, "is a constellation
within which there are two colliding
galaxies. These colliding galaxies
produce the most powerful
electromagnetic radiations in the
universe&mdash;an undecillion watts!"</p>

<p>"What's an undecillion?"</p>

<p>"An undecillion is ten raised to
the 36th power," Freddy sighed, fearing
that he wasn't getting through
to Willy.</p>

<p>"No foolin'? What's a watt ...
aw, you're pullin' my leg again, Freddy,
talkin' riddles. Where'd ya ever
learn to talk that way anyhow!"</p>

<p>"Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Oxford,
Georgia Tech, Oklahoma. Picked up
a little here, a little there," Freddy
said, reflecting on his indiscriminate
past.</p>

<p>"Aw, cut it out, Freddy! C'mon,
read it to me. Betcha can't! Where'd
ya say it was from? Cygnus?"</p>

<p>"Not Cygnus. Ganymede." Freddy
cleared his throat and rattled the
newspaper authoritatively. "Washington:
White House sources declared
today that intelligent beings
on a Jupiter moon have contacted the
United States government. While the
contents of the message have been
made secret, the White House emphasized
the message was friendly."</p>

<p>Freddy continued, "The signals,
which were intercepted yesterday,
were decoded this morning by a team
of government scientists and cryptographers
who had been at the task
all night. While officials were noncommittal
about the nature of the
message contained in the signals,
they declared, 'We are authorized to
state that the received message was
friendly and appears to represent a
sincere attempt by another race of
intelligent beings to contact the people
of Earth. A reply message is being
formulated.' Officials further explained
that the possibility of the
signal's being a hoax has been thoroughly
investigated and that there is
no doubt whatsoever that the message
is a genuine interspatial communication
from intelligent beings
on Ganymede. Ganymede is one of
twelve moons of the planet Jupiter,
and is larger than the planet Mercury."</p>

<p>Freddy stopped.</p>

<p>"Ain't there any more?" Willy
whined.</p>

<p>"The rest of it is about how far
away Ganymede is, and its relative
density and mass and stuff. You
wouldn't be interested, Willy."</p>

<p>"Oh. I guess not." Willy helped
himself to a peanut. "What's it mean,
Freddy?"</p>

<p>"Nothing much, Willy. Just that
there's people somewhere besides
here on Earth, and they called us on
the phone."</p>

<p>"Whadd'ya know about that!" Willy
gasped. "I didn't even know they
was other people!" He stared with
disbelief at the paper.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose anyone knew."</p>

<p>"How d'ya suppose they knew?"
Willy asked. "I mean, that we was
here, if we didn't know they was
there?"</p>

<p>"I've been wondering about that,
Willy. You know that last rocket we
shot?"</p>

<p>"From Cape Carnival you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yeh. It was supposed to go into
orbit around Jupiter. I wouldn't be
surprised if maybe it didn't land on
Ganymede; the people there could
have examined it, figured out where
it came from, and then radioed us on
the same frequency the rocket transmitter
used. Paper doesn't say that,
of course, but it's a reasonable hypothesis."</p>

<p>"Freddy, I think you must be a
genius or sumpin'."</p>

<p>Freddy smiled and stretched out to
sleep again as Willy wandered off,
staring blankly at the newspaper.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">Carlton Jones, America's Number
One personnel specialist, scowled at
the pamphlet on his desk.</p>

<p>SECRET, it said in big red letters
across the top and bottom. Special
Instructions for Operation Space
Case, said the smaller letters across
the middle of the top sheet.</p>

<p>"Now I ask you, Dwindle," Jones
said to his clerkish aide, "where, in
this worldful of specialists, am I going
to find someone with a well-rounded
education? Much less one
who'll take a chance on a flier like
this?"</p>

<p>"Gosh, Mr. Jones, I just wouldn't
know," Dwindle blinked. "Have you
tried looking through your files?"</p>

<p>"Have I tried looking through my
files," Jones sighed, looking at the
ceiling light. "Dwindle, my files include
every gainfully employed person
in the United States of America
and its possessions. Millions of them.
One doesn't just browse through the
files looking for things."</p>

<p>"Oh," Dwindle said. "I'm kinda
new at this specialty," he explained.</p>

<p>"Yes, Dwindle. However," Jones
continued, "one does make IBM runouts
to find things."</p>

<p>"Hey, that's great!" Dwindle said,
brightening. "Why don't you try making
an IBM runout?"</p>

<p>"I did, Dwindle. Please let me finish?
Our instructions call for finding
a person with a well-rounded education.
More specifically, a person who
is capable of intelligently discussing
and explaining some two dozen major
'fields of knowledge.' Plus, of
course, at least a passing acquaintance
with some one or two hundred
minor fields of knowledge.</p>

<p>"So I set Mathematics into the IBM
sorter. Mathematics is one of the major
fields of knowledge, you see."</p>

<p>"Yeh," Dwindle acknowledged.</p>

<p>"So I took the few million mathematicians'
cards which I got&mdash;good
mathematicians and bad mathematicians,
but at least people who can get
their decimals in the right place. I
set the IBM sorter for Biology, and
ran the mathematicians' cards
through. So I got several thousand
mathematician-biologists."</p>

<p>"That's pretty sharp!" Dwindle exclaimed
with a twinkle. "Whoever
thought of that!"</p>

<p>"Please, Dwindle," Jones moaned,
pressing his palms to his eyes. "Next
I sorted according to Geology. Three
hundred cards came through. Three
hundred people in America who
know their math, biology and geology!"</p>

<p>"That doesn't sound like so many
to me," Dwindle said hesitantly, as
if wondering what there was to get
so excited about.</p>

<p>"And of those three hundred, do
you know how many understand,
even vaguely, Electronics? Twelve.
And of those twelve, guess how many
have an adequate background in History
and Anthropology? Much less
an understanding of eighteen other
fields?"</p>

<p>"Not very many, I'll bet," Dwindle
replied smartly.</p>

<p>"None! Not even one! I tried running
the cards through in every order
imaginable. We've bred a race
of specialists and there's not a truly
educated man among us!"</p>

<p>"Say, you know what I bet? Even
if you did find a guy who's like what
all you said ..."</p>

<p>"Go ahead, Dwindle."</p>

<p>"... I bet he wouldn't even go
up there to Ganymede. I sure wouldn't!
I'd be scared to death," Dwindle
chattered, waving his finger. "How's
he gonna get back, even if he gets
there O.K.? Couldn't anyone fool me
with a bunch of pretty talk; I know
the government doesn't have a rocket
that could take off again after it got
there. Gotta have launching pads
and computers and all that stuff. Government
ever think about that?"</p>

<p>Jones held his head in anguish.
"Dwindle, why don't you be a good
boy and run along to the snack bar
for a coffee break? And bring me
some aspirin when you come back."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">Freddy the Fish, Willy and Oscar
Fronk were occupying the same
bench, a comradeship made necessary
by the overpopulation of the park on
such a glorious day. Oscar was surveying
the passing girls and scouting for
worthwhile cigarette stubs. Willy was
admiring a hovering beetle's power
of flight, and Freddy was reading a
discarded copy of <i>Scientific American</i>.</p>

<p>The beetle landed on Willy's
sleeve and promptly located a gaping
tear in the fabric, through which
bare arm showed. Willy raised his
other hand menacingly.</p>

<p>"Don't," Freddy barked, causing
Willy to jump with enough force to
dislodge the beetle.</p>

<p>"Aw, Freddy," Willy whined, "why
dintcha lemme kill it? What good's
a stupid bug?"</p>

<p>"That would have been a rather
unfortunate kill, Willy, by your bare
hand on your bare arm. You must
learn to be cognizant of our insect
friends and insect enemies."</p>

<p>"So what's he, poison or sumpin'?"</p>

<p>"Unpleasant, at least," Freddy said.
"That was a blister beetle; smash it
on your arm and you'll grow a nice
welt. A member of the Meloidae
family."</p>

<p>"You mean bugs have families and
all, too?" Willy asked.</p>

<p>"Beetle 'families' are groupings of
similar species of insects," Freddy explained.
"Not actually kinfolk. For
instance, this beetle is related to the
Lytta vesicatoria of southern Europe,
more commonly known as the&mdash;"
Freddy glanced out of the corner of
his eye at Oscar, hoping to shield the
next bit of information from his
perverted brain, and whispered the
name.</p>

<p>Willy's eyes widened. "Hey, Oscar,"
he hollered, jumping up. "You
hear what Freddy said? That bug I
almost swatted's practically a Spanish
Fly!"</p>

<p>"Which way'd he go?" Oscar
squeaked, allowing his collection of
stubs to scatter as he hopped around,
looking on and under and behind the
bench for the escaping insect.</p>

<p>"Hold it, hold it," Freddy commanded,
trying to restore order. "I
said it's like it, not IS it. It doesn't
have what it takes, so skip it, huh?"</p>

<p>Willy and Oscar sat down again.
"Freddy," Willy sighed with adoration,
"how'd ya ever get so smart? I
mean, bein' a bum and all?"</p>

<p>"I keep telling you guys; I went
to nothing but the finest universities.
Well, except toward the end, when
I was getting desperate, I guess I
wasn't so choosy."</p>

<p>"Aw, g'wan now, Freddy. Collitches
cost money, and you're as poor as
the rest of us. Bummin' for a cuppa
coffee, and all the time talking about
Yale, and Oxford, and Hah-vad."</p>

<p>"What would you say, Willy, if I
told you that once I belonged to the
richest family in Mississippi?"</p>

<p>"I'd say Mississippi was a pretty
poor state," Willy said, and Oscar giggled.</p>

<p>"I once was Frederik Van Smelt,
spoiled son of the wealthy shrimp
and oyster scion. And there's nothing
as bad, my father said, as spoiled
Smelt. He disowned me, of course. I
owned six Cadillacs&mdash;one right after
the other, I wrecked them all. I traveled
all over the world and probably
counteracted a billion dollars' worth
of foreign aid. I was kicked out of
the best schools in the world."</p>

<p>"How come if you're so smart you
flunked out of all them schools?"
Oscar asked.</p>

<p>"Me? Flunked out? I never made
less than an A in any course I took
during my eight years at war with
college. I was expelled from nine
schools and barely escaped the highway
patrol when I was bootlegging
at Oklahoma University!"</p>

<p>"Freddy," Willy said, "you're lyin'
like a dog, butcha make it sound s'
real!"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">Jones squirmed uncomfortably in
his seat in the briefing room, phrasing
and rephrasing his thoughts. It
seemed that no matter which arrangement
of words he chose, it still was
going to be obvious that he'd flopped.
He re-examined his fingernails and
selected one which was still long
enough to chew.</p>

<p>General Marcher concluded his
current appraisal of the situation and
began calling on the various individuals
with whom certain phases of
OPERATION SPACE CASE had
been entrusted. Jones groaned as each
arose and gave favorable progress
reports.</p>

<p>"The pod is completed and has
been tested, sir. It will by no means
be plush, but it will be sufficiently
comfortable even for the long voyage
to Ganymede."</p>

<p>"The guidance system is perfected
to the extent that we need."</p>

<p>"There are no further deceleration
problems to be solved."</p>

<p>"The crash program has been approved
for the two-way rocket; it is
on the drawing board and current
estimates are that the envoy can be
brought back in three years."</p>

<p>"Ganymede has replied to our last
message; a suitable artificial environment
will be available for the envoy."</p>

<p>"Personnel Specialist Jones?"</p>

<p>Carlton gave his chin a final
sweaty rub and slowly rose to his
feet. "General Marcher, sir," he
choked, "I'm ... we're ... experiencing
a little difficulty finding a
volunteer, so far&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Negative perspiration on that
count, Jones," the Project Officer interrupted.
"The draft has never been
abolished; we can grab anyone you
put your finger on! Now, who will it
be?"</p>

<p>"Sir, it doesn't seem to be that so
much as ... well ... sir, has any
consideration been given to perhaps
sending a delegation rather than a
single envoy?"</p>

<p>The general smiled broadly. "Now,
that is more like it! I take it you
mean you have a number of equally-qualified
persons who have expressed
an intense desire to go to Ganymede,
and there is no way to impartially
select one of these men over the
others? This is commendable. However,
our space limitation clearly precludes
sending more than one person.
I'm afraid you will just have to
make your choice from a hat."</p>

<p>Jones turned a trifle redder. "That's
not exactly the problem, either, sir."</p>

<p>The general's smile wilted and became
a frozen frown. "Just exactly
what are you trying to say, Jones?"</p>

<p>"There's no one who can meet the
qualifications, sir," Jones said, feeling
sick at his stomach.</p>

<p>"Are you telling me that in the entire
United States, there is not one
person who has a basic understanding
of the twenty-four major fields?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that's right, sir."</p>

<p>"See me after the briefing, Jones.
I'm certain that the Foremost Personnel
Specialist in the United States
must have some further ideas on this
matter."</p>

<p>Jones sank slowly back into his
seat and covered his face with his
hands. "I'm a goner," he whispered to
himself. "Jones, you can be replaced."</p>

<p>Dwindle, sitting on his left, suddenly
punched him vigorously in the
ribs. "Say, Mr. Jones," he rattled, "I
just thought of a great idea."</p>

<p>"Tell it to the general," Jones
moaned. "Maybe then he'll realize
what a handicap I've been working
under."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">"Hi ya, Freddy," Willy said, sitting
down on the bench and helping himself
to some peanuts. "Workin' a
crossword puzzle?"</p>

<p>Freddy pocketed his pencil stub
and laid aside the newspaper. "Naw,
not this time. Just playing around
with one of those 'We're looking for
bright young men' ads."</p>

<p>"Freddy! Y'ain't thinkin' a gettin'
a JOB?"</p>

<p>"Nothing like that," Freddy
laughed. "Just, exercising my mind.
Filling out one of those little tests
they always have. Helps keep a fella
sharp, you know."</p>

<p>"Yeh, I seen the kind. Like what
has pictures and you're supposed to
find things wrong in the picture like
dames with beards and dogs with six
feet?"</p>

<p>"Kinda like that, only this one's all
written and is a little tougher. You're
supposed to send the answers in and
whoever has good answers gets to
take a tougher test and whoever does
good on that test gets the job. Probably
selling neckties on the corner or
something."</p>

<p>"No kiddin'. That what it says?"</p>

<p>"Just says 'handsome rewards,' but
that's probably close to it."</p>

<p>"You gonna send it in?" Willy
asked.</p>

<p>"Naw, I just fill 'em out for fun,
like I said. Can you imagine me peddling
neckties on the corner?"</p>

<p>"Then how d'ya know if you got
the right answers?"</p>

<p>"Hell, I know the answers," Freddy
bragged. "Like I said, this is just
exercise. Mental gymnastics. Like this
last one; it was pretty tough compared
to most of them. Had some
questions about things I hadn't even
thought about since college, things
I'd forgotten I knew. What good's an
education if you forget what things
you know?"</p>

<p>"That's why I never bothered,"
Willy agreed. "'Cause I never could
remember things so good."</p>

<p>"No, Willy. You've got it all
wrong. I still know it, I just didn't
know I know it."</p>

<p>"Aw, Freddy," Willy said unhappily.
"You're pullin' my leg again!"</p>

<p>"Suit yourself," Freddy smiled.
"Hold down the bench for me, O.K.?
I'll be right back."</p>

<p>Willy watched Freddy until he
went into the little brick building in
the center of the park, and then
grabbed Freddy's newspaper and
scampered over to Oscar's bench.</p>

<p>"Hey, you know how Freddy's always
talkin' big about how much he
knows," Willy said breathlessly. "I
got an idea how to call his bluff. He
filled out one of these tests and says
he knows all the answers. Let's send
it in and see if he's as smart as he
says!"</p>

<p>"Yeh! That's great, Willy!" Then
Oscar's face darkened. "Wonder
where we can steal a stamp?"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">"That was a pretty good idea of
mine, about advertising in the paper,
wasn't it, Mr. Jones?" Dwindle,
America's Number One Personnel
Specialist, asked his surly assistant.</p>

<p>"Yes, Dwindle."</p>

<p>Jones stared gloomily out the fourteenth
story window into the park,
where the local bums were loafing
and sleeping and feeding peanuts to
the pigeons. He was nauseated with
the prospect of having to address his
new boss as "Mr. Dwindle," and was
toying with the idea of abandoning
his specialty completely to join the
ranks of the happy, carefree unemployed.
He watched as two uniformed
policemen approached one of the less
wholesome-appearing characters.</p>

<p>"No, I don't suppose I could tolerate
being in and out of jail every
week on a vagrancy charge," he told
himself. But then he smiled bitterly
as he thought of the strange parallel
between the policemen arresting the
bum and other officials, elsewhere in
the United States, tapping respectable
citizens on the shoulder at this
very moment.</p>

<p>"Dwindle, do you really think it
was wise to issue warrants to arrest
all those persons who scored perfect
on the first test? How many did you
say there were?"</p>

<p>"Only a hundred or so," Dwindle
smiled sweetly. "And besides, they're
not being arrested. General Marcher
explained to you that they are being
drafted into the service of the government.
Honestly, sometimes I think
you worry too much."</p>

<p>Jones turned back to the window,
brooding over Dwindle's transformation.
"Maybe so," he sighed, watching
the newly-arrested vagrant pointing
an accusing finger toward one of the
other bums.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">Willy strained and twisted, trying
to reclaim his arm from the policeman's grip.</p>

<p>"Honest, you guys. I didn't know
it was against the law. Aw, I figgered
it was against the rules mebbe to
send in somebody else's answers, but
we wuz only makin' a joke, Oscar 'n'
me. Oscar's the one who actual put it
in the mailbox and stole the stamp!
I bet he's the one you're after!"</p>

<p>"Now calm down, Willy," the
beefy policeman coaxed. "No one's
broken any law. Nobody's under arrest.
We just want to chat a minute
with whoever it was filled out that
test."</p>

<p>"Yeh, Willy," the second policeman
broke in, "if you didn't do it,
and I believe you when you say you
didn't, then who did?"</p>

<p>"What's it to ya?" Willy asked, his
mouth twitching nervously.</p>

<p>The first policeman glanced at the
second and then back at Willy. "Well,
it's like this, Willy," he said. "Whoever
filled out those answers got every
one of them right. The people
who run the contest want to meet
the guy, see? And they asked us to
help find him because we know you
people better than anyone else does.
See? That's all!"</p>

<p>"Yeh," said the second. "That's all.
Now who did it?"</p>

<p>Willy stood with his jaw drooping
for a moment. "You mean he got
ever' last one of 'em right?" he
asked. "Freddy was always braggin'
about his brains, but me 'n' Oscar figgered
he was makin' most of it up."</p>

<p>"Freddy who? Freddy the Fish you
mean?"</p>

<p>"Yeh, Freddy." Willy perked up
and turned toward Freddy's bench.
"Hey, Freddy! Hey, you know that
test you took in the newspaper that
you didn't know I sent in? You won
the contest or sumpin'! Hey, that's
great!"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">Jones and Dwindle watched the
draftees file into the examination
room.</p>

<p>"I still don't see how this is going
to solve the problem," Jones frowned.</p>

<p>"I believe it will," Dwindle contradicted him.
"Specialists in each of the
major fields have been consulted,
and each provided fifty questions."</p>

<p>"The hardest questions they could
think up, I imagine."</p>

<p>"No, not at all. The purpose is to
provide comprehensive coverage of
each field. And each question is of
the type that, if the examinee knows
the answer, it can be reasonably assumed
that he knows quite a bit in
that particular phase of the field. For
instance, if he knows what enzyme is
associated with the stomach, he probably
knows what enzyme is associated
with the liver."</p>

<p>"I know one big problem you're
going to run into," Jones sulked.
"Just like the IBM cards. You're going
to find one guy who clobbers the
Electronics part of the test but completely
busts out in History and everything
else."</p>

<p>"I don't think so," Dwindle said.
"The preliminary test will have taken
care of that. It was designed so that,
in order to answer every question
right, a person would have to have at
least a rudimentary knowledge of all
twenty-four major fields."</p>

<p>As Jones was considering whether
it would be better to slit his own
throat or Dwindle's, General Marcher
entered the room and approached.</p>

<p>"Excellent. Excellent," the general
declared. "A very distinguished-looking
group you've assembled here,
Dwindle. Hello, Jones."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Dwindle said, "with the
possible exception of the seedy chap
in the rear."</p>

<p>Jones looked to the rear of the
room, and his eyes bugged.</p>

<p>Freddy the Fish, clean-shaven but
tattered, was alternately wetting the
pencil lead in his mouth and eating
peanuts.</p>

<p>"That's the bum who feeds sparrows
in the park!" Jones gasped.
"How did he get out of jail so quick?
I saw a couple of policemen haul
him off just a day or so ago."</p>

<p>"This is where they hauled him
to," General Marcher said. "It just so
happens that he answered every question
right on the preliminary examination.
He says his name's Freddy
Smith, although I doubt that he
could prove it."</p>

<p>"He says he never had a father,"
Dwindle added. "Says his family was
too poor."</p>

<p>Jones stared at General Marcher,
then stared at Dwindle, then turned
and stared at Freddy the Fish, who
had just left his seat and was ambling
toward the trio.</p>

<p>"Looks like he's throwing in the
towel," Jones, said happily. "He's
bringing his paper with him."</p>

<p>"Maybe he just wants clarification
on a question," Dwindle said.</p>

<p>"I'm all done," Freddy said. "Who
gets this?"</p>

<p>"Go ahead, Dwindle," Carlton
Jones smirked. "Grade the man's paper.
He's all done."</p>

<p>Dwindle smiled uncertainly.
"You're allowed all the time you
need, Mr. Smith."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's O.K. I'm done."</p>

<p>Dwindle produced his red pencil
and the answer sheet which had
1,200 small circles punched in it. He
sat down, placed the key over the
test paper, and began searching for
white spaces showing through.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">"That's the last one, sir," Dwindle
said six hours later as he added the
one hundred twelfth graded test to
the neat stack at the left of his desk.
He stared through the thousand-plus
holes in the answer key as if expecting
the holes to shift.</p>

<p>"And still no change in the standings?"
General Marcher asked again.</p>

<p>"Mr. Smith still has the best grade,"
Dwindle answered.</p>

<p>"The percentages again?" the general
asked.</p>

<p>"Over all, ninety-six per cent for
Mr. Smith," Dwindle said for the
fourth time. "His lowest percentage
in any one category was eighty per
cent. The next highest score was by
Dr. Schmelling, who had seventy-eight
per cent, but he failed in six
categories. The third highest score
was by Dr. Ranson, seventy-six per
cent, failing in seven categories. The
fourth highest score was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough. Enough," General
Marcher interrupted. "I think we've
found our man, don't you, Dwindle?"</p>

<p>"I hope we don't have to use pressure,
sir," Dwindle replied.</p>

<p>Jones turned from the window,
from which he was observing the
bums in the park. "How can you possibly
consider such a thing," he
blurted, "as to send a penniless, unemployed,
dirty, ragged tramp to
Ganymede as the United States'
Number One emissary?"</p>

<p>"Jones, perhaps I'd best clarify a
point or two for you," General
Marcher said in measured tones.
"We've been searching the nation
over, seeking a man who can fulfill
our exacting requirements. We have
found that man. There is no doubt in
my mind that Mr. Smith possesses the
greatest single store of knowledge
about this planet and its people. So
far as I'm concerned, which is considerable,
it doesn't matter that this
man has chosen the way of a philosopher
instead of seeking an occupation.
It doesn't matter that he lacks
the necessary status to be listed on
your IBM cards. It doesn't matter
that you failed to find this man, because
Dwindle succeeded. And, it
doesn't matter whether I ever see
you again!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Jones said, and picked
up his hat and left.</p>

<p>"Now, back to the business at
hand, Dwindle. You say these prospects
don't know the reasons behind
the test?"</p>

<p>"That is correct, sir. I feared there
might be some temptation for the
prospects to not do their best, if they
knew that success might result in
their being removed from the face of
the Earth."</p>

<p>"Wise. Then I suggest we approach
Mr. Smith on the idea, cautiously,
to determine his sentiments.
If he doesn't want to go, of course,
we've got to draft him."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">Freddy cracked the peanut, put half
in his mouth and tossed the other
half to the sparrows.</p>

<p>"I might be going away for a
while, Willy," he said, ending a rather
long silence.</p>

<p>"You ain't gettin' a job, are ya
Freddy?"</p>

<p>"Watch yer language," Oscar scolded.</p>

<p>"Naw, not really a job. At least not
the kind you think of. Sort of an all-expense-paid
vacation, with a change
of scenery."</p>

<p>"Ya ain't had a run-in with the
bulls, have ya?" the stricken Willy
asked.</p>

<p>"Me? You know me better, Willy.
Nothing like that. And I'm not even
sure the thing will pan out, but you
know all those newspaper stories
about messages from another planet?"</p>

<p>"Yeh! Yeh! Ya read it to me!"
Willy jabbered excitedly.</p>

<p>"And that test I took that you sent
in and the fellas talked to me about?"</p>

<p>"Yeh! Say, I hope that didn't make
you trouble, Freddy, 'cuz me 'n' Oscar
was just kinda jokin', see, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's O.K., Willy. Well, one of the
fellas I talked to was General Marcher,
who's been mentioned in the
newspaper stories in connection
with ... here, Willy, take these,"
he interrupted himself when he saw
the two men approaching. "See that
new guy at the bench over yonder?
Give him these peanuts. I think he'd
like to feed my sparrows while I'm
gone. Name's Jones, and he'll probably
be around for a spell."</p>

<p>Freddy stood up to greet the two
arrivals.</p>

<p>"Hello, general," he said, tipping
his battered cap. "It's about the trip
to Ganymede, I suppose?"</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
